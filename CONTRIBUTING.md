Workflow
------------------------------
 
1. Create a branch directly in this repo or a fork (if you don't have push access). Please name
branches within this repository `feature/<description>` or `fix/description`. For example, 
something like `feature/upgrade_agent_0.2.3-70`.

1. Create an issue or open a pull request (PR). If you aren't sure your PR will solve the issue
or may be controversial, we're okay with you opening an issue separately and linking to it in 
your PR. That way, if the PR is not accepted, the issue will remain and be tracked.

1. Clone the fork/branch locally.
    
1. Close (and reference) issues by the `closes #XXX` or `fixes #XXX` notation in the commit
message. Please use a descriptive, useful commit message that could be used to understand why a
particular change was made.
        
1. Keep pushing commits to the initial branch using `--amend`/`--rebase` as necessary. Don't mix 
unrelated issues in a single branch.

1. Clean up the branch (rebase with master to synchronize, squash, edit commits, test, etc.) to
prepare for it to be merged.

1. If you didn't open a pull request already, do so now. 

1. After reviewing your commits for documentation, passed continuous integration (CI) tests, 
version bumps, changelogs, and good, descriptive commit messages, a project maintainer can merge your request.

1. Create/update the changelog if necessary.
